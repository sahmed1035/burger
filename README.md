 Node Express Handlebars (week 14 assignment)

## Project Description
link to the site: [Burger](https://syeda-friend-finder1.herokuapp.com/)
This is a burger logger app where you can create and devour burger of your choice. This is a full-stack site that takes results from users' input. 
* This restaurant app  lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger  moves to the right side of the page.

* This app store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.


### Compatibility logic:
It follows MVC design pattern.
These are the methods you will need to use in order to retrieve and store data in your database.

     * `selectAll()`
     * `insertOne()`
     * `updateOne()`
